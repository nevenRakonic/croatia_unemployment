# Croatian Unemployment App

This application scrapes data from the Croatian unemployment office and displays it in a form of a chart.
It was ritten as an exercise to learn more about hosting applications on nginx servers and working with cron jobs.

The backend language used is Ruby with the Sinatra micro framework, while PostgresSQL is the database of choice.
